# Data structures and algorithms in Javascript

## Inroduction:
Hi there 👋 . This is a place where I share my thoughts and notes about data structures and algorithms in JS. The drive of this project is to help Javascript / Typescript developers to understand core software principles and hopefully to help them write better code. **NOTE**: I'm still actively working on this repository, so I'm sorry if you find some unfinished pages. I am doing my best to get this done as soon as possible. Any feedback would be much appreciated. Have a good read! 📚.

## Good code is :

- Readable, refer to the code’s simplicity and clarity.
- Scalable, refer to the code’s ability to scale up without increasing time and space complexity.

## Useful notes :
- Programs store `variables` in `RAM`.
- `RAM` or **Random Access Memory** offers random access to data addresses without climbing up or down the memory list.
- `RAM` is a data structure that stores data in `addresses`.
- Each address in RAM holds `8 bits` of numbers that make up one `Byte`.
- A bit is like an electrical switch that turns on `1` and off `0`.
- The CPU is connected to what is known as a `memory controller` that does reading and writing to memory.
- A `Cache` is a CPU's tiny memory that stores recent data.
- An integer is represented in `32 bits`, an average of 4 addresses.
- Computers can have 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits per address.
- An **`integer overflow`** occurs when an **`arithmetic operation`** attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits – either higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.
- An example of integer overflow happens when using `Math.pow()`. If the result is bigger than a certain threshold, it’ll be evaluated to `infinity` instead.
